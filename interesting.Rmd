These problems are challenging, but require only basic undergraduate mathematics, at most.

# Random contractions

Contractions example

# Stick breaking

Stick breaking has a long history in mathematics. For instance we can ask, for the the probability that we can form a triangle from the segments of a broken stick. More generally, we can ask for the probability of forming a $n$-gon after making $n$ breaks (resulting in $n+1$ segments).

A Shiny interactive app to investigating segment lengths in the $n$ break case can be found under the R section of the [Code tab](code.html#deployment:_shiny_and_knitr) on this site. Tap [here](https://chris-x.shinyapps.io/StickBreak/) to launch the app.

## Expected length of 3 segments

__If I break a stick of unit length into three random pieces, what's the expected
length of the largest piece?__
