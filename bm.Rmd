Topics to focus on:

* Indices and logs
* Graphs, curves and functions 
* Series and limits

These topics could reasonably be covered by self-study, although I am happy to go through them.

* Integration
* Expansions and binomial theorem

<br>

Here are some integration and binomial expansion questions for self-study. More can be found in your text book.

<br>

1. Show that 
$\int 8\sqrt{x}\:dx=\frac{16}{3}x^{3/2}+C$

<br>

2. By computing $\int_{1}^{2} a x^{-2}\:dx=5$, show that the constant $a=10$

<br>

3. 

a) Show that $\int x^{-4/3}\:dx=-3x^{-1/3}+C,$ where $C$ is the constant of integration. 

b) Using this result, find the value of the constant $b$ that satisfies 
\[b\int_{1}^{8} x^{-4/3}\:dx=6\]

<br>

4. Compute the value of $\int_{1}^{2}\frac{1}{x^{3}}-\frac{x^{3}}{4}\:dx$. What does this result say about the area(s) bounded by the graph of $y=\frac{1}{x^{3}}-\frac{x^{3}}{4}$, and the $x$-axis over the range $x=1$ to $x=2$?

<br>

5. By expanding brackets, show that $(1-x)^{2} +2x > 0$ for all $x$.

<br>

6. 

a) By expanding the brackets show that $(1+x)^{2}=1+2x+x^{2}$


b) By using the fact that 
\[
\frac{a^{2}}{y^{2}}=\left(\frac{a}{y}\right)^{2}
\]
make a suitable substitution for $x$, and deduce the values of $p$ and $q$ that satisfy
\[
\left(1-\frac{4}{y^{2}}\right)^{2}=1+\frac{p}{y^{2}}+\frac{q}{y^{4}}
\]

<br>

7. 

a) For $a$ a constant, by expanding the brackets show that $(a+x)^{3}=a^{3}+3a^{2}x+3ax^{2}+x^{3}$


b) Use the result of part a) to compute
\[
\int_{0}^{1} (a+x)^{3}\:dx
\]

leaving your answer in terms of the __constant__ $a$.

c) Hence, using the result to part b), find the three possible values of $a$ that satisfy


\[
\int_{0}^{1} (a+x)^{3}\:dx=\frac{1}{4}+\frac{a}{2}
\]
