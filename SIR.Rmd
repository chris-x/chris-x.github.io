## SIR models

The prototypical model for how a contagious disease spreads throughout a population was introduced in a 1927 [paper](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rspa.1927.0118) by [William Kermack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Ogilvy_Kermack), a Scottish biochemist, and [Lt Col Anderson McKendrick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_Gray_McKendrick) a Scottish military physician. In that paper, they introduce the *epidemic model*, establishing a general theory of infectious disease transmission, and making a seminal contribution to mathematical epidemiology.

McKendrick made ground-breaking contributions to mathematical biology, and epidemiology in particular. These achievements are made even more remarkable considering McKendrick was technically an amateur mathematician.

Many models of infectious disease are in some way a variant of the *epidemic model* introduced by Kermack and McKendrick. Their model is an example of what is now called *compartment modelling*, where *material* (people, in this case) is modelled as moving between certain states or homogeneous compartments (infected, recovered, etc.). Such models are well-suited to be analysed as dynamical systems (a family of differential equations), and are used in numerous other areas of biology.

A special case occurs when infection rate and recovery rate are considered constant (along with some other simplifying assumptions). In this case, the *epidemic model* reduces to the so-called the SIR model: **S**usceptible **I**nfected **R**ecovered

\begin{align}
\frac{dS}{dt}=& \: -\beta SI\\[10pt]
\frac{dI}{dt}=& \: \beta SI -\gamma I\\[10pt]
\frac{dR}{dt}=& \: \gamma I 
\end{align}


The parameters $\beta$ and $\gamma$ have the following meaning:


$\beta$ is the rate at which *susceptibles* move to being *infected* per day, and captures both the probability of a susceptible and infected individuals having contact and a successful transmission of the disease taking place.


$\gamma$ captures the length of days an individual remains infected, say $D$. Then ($1/\gamma = D$)


## $R_{0}$
In this model, the well-known reproduction number $R_{0}$ used to denote how infectious a disease may be, is defined as $R_{0}=\beta S / \gamma$.

The quantity $R_{0}$ is one of epidemiology's most important, and signifies the number of secondary infections caused by a single primary infection. When $R_{0}<1$, each infected person will infect fewer than 1 person before recovery (or death), and therefore the epidemic will fizzle out. On the other hand, when $R_{0}>1$ each infected person will infect more than 1 person, and the disease spreads.


Current estimates of $R_{0}$ for COVID-19 are between 2 and 3.

## Criticism of the differential equation approach


Compartment modelling assumes that compartments are homogeneous. This simply means any *material* in any given compartment are identical to any other in the same compartment. Increasing the number of compartments of a model in some sense negates this, but makes analysis more cumbersome.


A bigger issue with SIR-like models is not with the underlying compartmental apparatus, but in the assumptions required to analyse such systems with differential equations. Differential equations of the above nature, impose the assumption that a system is *well-mixed*. In the context above, this translates as any *susceptible* being equally likely to come into contact with any other *infected*, which is obviously not the case in real life. Disease outbreaks emerge in localised clusters (not randomly across a nation...), mirroring the __very__ local nature of the vast majority of individuals daily movement patterns.


Alternative modelling approaches, such as agent-based dynamics taking place on networks, do not impose such unrealistic assumptions. These tools allow the careful modelling of infrastructure networks (train, bus, air), and other places people may *mix*, in conjunction with more realistic localised movement and contact patterns.
