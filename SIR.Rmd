## SIR models

The prototypical model for how a contagious disease spreads throughout a population was introduced in a 1927 [paper](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rspa.1927.0118) by [William Kermack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Ogilvy_Kermack), a Scottish biochemist, and [Lt Col Anderson McKendrick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_Gray_McKendrick) a Scottish military physician. In that paper, they introduce the *epidemic model*, establishing a general theory of infectious disease transmission, and making a seminal contribution to mathematical epidemiology.

McKendrick made ground-breaking contributions to mathematical biology, and epidemiology in particular. These achievements are made even more remarkable considering McKendrick was technically an amateur mathematician.

Many models of infectious disease are in some way a variant of the *epidemic model* introduced by Kermack and McKendrick. Their model is an example of what is now called *compartment modelling*, where *material* (people, in this case) is modelled as moving between certain states or homogeneous compartments (infected, recovered, etc.). Such models are well-suited to be analysed as dynamical systems (a family of differential equations), and are used in numerous other areas of biology.

A special case occurs when infection rate and recovery rate are considered constant (along with some other simplifying assumptions). In this case, the *epidemic model* reduces to the so-called the SIR model: **S**usceptible **I**nfected **R**ecovered

\begin{align}
\frac{dS}{dt}=& \: -\beta SI\\[10pt]
\frac{dI}{dt}=& \: \beta SI -\gamma I\\[10pt]
\frac{dR}{dt}=& \: \gamma I 
\end{align}

In this model, the well-known reproduction number $R_{0}$ used to denote how infectious a disease may be, is defined as $R_{0}=\beta S / \gamma$.

The quantity $R_{0}$ is one of epidemiology's most important, and signifies the number of secondary infections caused by a single primary infection. When $R_{0}<1$, each infected person will infect fewer than 1 person before recovery (or death), and therefore the epidemic will fizzle out. On the other hand, when $R_{0}>1$ each infected person will infect more than 1 person, and the disease spreads.

Current estimates of $R_{0}$ for COVID-19 are between 2 and 3.
