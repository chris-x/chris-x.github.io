# Python

I first used [Python](https://www.python.org/) in 2011, and use it when/where I can. Python is a simple and readable language to work with, and is sufficiently distinct from R and C++ to make learning and developing with it interesting and useful. Although not specifically designed for statistical data analysis, Python has excellent support for it via the [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) data analysis library.

For statistical / machine learning, the well-known [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is excellent, and there is Python support for deep learning via [Keras](https://keras.io/) (running on theano or TensorFlow).

## R v Python?

See [this excellent video](https://blog.dominodatalab.com/video-huge-debate-r-vs-python-data-science/) for a comparison of Python and R in terms of data science. The answer is, of course, both are excellent and neither one is perfect.
